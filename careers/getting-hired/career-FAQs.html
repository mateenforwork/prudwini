				<h3>The Search and Application Process</h3>

				<p><strong>How can I request a special accommodation for submitting my application?</strong></p>

				<p>At HCSC, we are committed to maintaining an environment of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action. To request special accommodation to submit an application, please contact us at: 866.977.7378 or email us at: <a href="mailto:HCSC_AskMyHR@ehr.com">HCSC_AskMyHR@ehr.com</a></p>

				<p><strong>How do I search for available positions at HCSC?</strong></p>

				<p>Throughout our career site you will see buttons encouraging you to â€œSearch Jobsâ€?. Clicking on one of these buttons will take you to our Job Search home page, where you can search current opportunities by keyword, functional area and location.</p>

				<p><strong>How do I submit an application for a position?</strong></p>

				<p>Once you have located a job that fits your qualifications and interests, please apply through this career site by clicking â€œSubmit Now!â€? If you have not registered with us already, you will need to create a user name and password and complete some general profile information. Once you have completed your registration, you will be able to apply to your position of interest. Make sure that you continue to the application after filling out your profile information. Youâ€™ll know you have applied when you receive a confirmation message that indicates that you applied for the specific job.</p>

				<p><strong>Do I need to apply for an open position in order to submit my job profile?</strong></p>

				<p>You can complete a profile with us without applying for a specific job. That may save you some time when you are ready to apply for a specific job. After you have registered on our career site, you will have the opportunity to create a custom job profile. The job profile allows us to find positions that match your interests and forward them on to you.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Can I modify my profile at any time?</strong></p>

				<p>Yes, you are free to update your profile as often as youâ€™d like.</p>

				
				<h3>Technical Questions</h3>

				<p><strong>I want to apply for a job but my password is not working. What should I do?</strong></p>

				<p>On the Job Search page, find the <a href="https://hcscrccorp.peoplefluent.com/res_joblist.html" target="_blank">Login link</a>. Once on the Login page, enter your email address into the â€œForgot Passwordâ€? field. An email with your registration name and password will be sent to your preferred email address.</p>


				<p><strong>I have requested my username or password to be forwarded to my preferred email address, but havenâ€™t received it. What should I do?</strong></p>

				<p>Verify that the preferred e-mail address that you previously provided on your application is the same address you are currently using. If so, remove your spam blocker long enough for the e-mail with the login information to get through. If you are still not receiving the information, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:HCSC_AskMyHR@ehr.com">HCSC_AskMyHR@ehr.com</a> with an alternate email address and your profile will be changed.</p>

				<p><strong>How do I delete or update my resume?</strong></p>

				<p>If a resume has already been submitted with an application, it cannot be updated. If you are invited to interview, however, youâ€™re welcome to provide an updated version of your resume.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Which browser is recommended for the best application experience?</strong></p>

				<p>Our online application is designed to work best with the most recent version of Internet Explorer (IE). <strong>Candidates might have the following issues with the online application: Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 may not display the career site correctly,  Apple Safari does not support the Sign In with LinkedIn feature. Google Chrome on an Apple iPhone or iPad cannot upload files from Dropbox or Google Drive.</strong></p>
