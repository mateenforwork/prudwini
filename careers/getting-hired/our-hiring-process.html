			<h2>Our Application Process</h2>

			<p>At HCSC, we understand your time is important. It is our goal to make things as simple and transparent as possible around
				our application process so you’ll know what to expect. Here’s a step-by-step look.</p>


			<h3>Search, Explore &#38; Apply</h3>

			<p>All of our open jobs are listed on our
				<a href="../job-search/index.html">website</a>. Search for jobs that fit your background and career interests. Once you see a job that interests you, click
				the “Submit Now�? to start your application. If you do not see a job that fits your skills or interests, register to
				receive email notifications as new jobs become available.
			</p>
			<p>At HCSC, we are committed to maintaining an environment of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action. To request special
				accommodation to submit an application, please contact us at:
				<strong>866.977.7378</strong> or email us at:
				<a href="mailto:HCSC_AskMyHR@ehr.com?Subject=Applicant Accommodation Request">HCSC_AskMyHR@ehr.com</a>.</p>

			<h3>The Application</h3>

			<p>Once you click “Submit Now�? you will be asked to either login if you have previously created a profile or create an account
				by registering with your email and a password.</p>

			<p>Once you have logged in or created an account you will be asked to submit your resume and answer additional relevant questions.
				Make sure you continue all the way through the application in addition to the initial profile information.</p>

			<p>The online application is the place to put your best foot forward to the recruiting team and hiring manager. Be sure to
				complete all questions as thoroughly as possible.</p>


			<h3>The Interview</h3>

			<p>Our recruiters work closely with the hiring managers to assess applications for each job opening. If your application
				is selected, you will be contacted by a recruiter to schedule an initial interview. Typically the first interview is
				by phone. After that you will be contacted to inform you of next steps in the process. The process varies by business
				unit but typically includes in-person interviews with the hiring manager and other members of the team you would be working
				with.
			</p>

			<p>To prepare for your interview, be sure to learn in advance about our company and culture—you will find information throughout
				our Careers site to help you prepare. Also, follow us on
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-illinois-new-mexico-oklahoma-&amp;-texas"
				    target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and
				<a href="https://twitter.com/hcsc" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for even more insight and information.</p>


			<h3>The Offer</h3>

			<p>If you have successfully completed the process and are identified as the candidate we would like to hire, your recruiter
				will reach out to you to discuss the details of the offer. You will also receive an offer letter to confirm the offer
				details and provide you with additional information. The recruiter will work closely with you to make sure all your questions
				are answered.</p>


			<h3>Pre-Employment</h3>

			<p>All offers of employment extended by HCSC are contingent upon successful completion of all lawful pre-employment checks,
				including but not limited to, background checks and drug screening. You’ll receive information on completing these checks
				from the recruiting team and will need to act on them in a timely manner.</p>


			<h3>Onboarding</h3>

				Please read through the information and complete any requested tasks. We look forward to seeing you on your first day
				at HCSC!</p>
