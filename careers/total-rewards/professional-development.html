			<p>At HCSC, each employee owns a vital stake in building an even stronger, even smarter and more efficient organization.
				We are committed to discovering new ideas, finding a better way, and asking the right questions. Ongoing learning and
				development opportunities help foster this kind of creative thought.</p>
			<p>We seek talented individuals passionate about the work they do and the impact they seek to have as they progress in their
				careers. If that's you, here's how HCSC can help you realize your fullest career potential.</p>

			<h3>Education Assistance</h3>
			<p>We believe in your continued growth and education. HCSC provides up to $5,250 (tax free) annually for tuition toward a
				degree, or $2,000 toward certificates or professional licenses.</p>

			<h3>Learning Programs</h3>

			<h4>Onboarding</h4>
			<p>Prior to your first day at HCSC, you'll receive helpful information to prepare you for your new job through our online
				onboarding tool, Red Carpet. HCSC offers 90-day onboarding programs for all employees, including specific focus areas
				for new leaders.</p>

			<h4>Professional Development</h4>
			<p>HCSC encourages development at all levels, allowing employees to build and enhance skills through a variety of programs
				and opportunities. We empower employees to think through their individual career goals and needs and understand individual
				opportunities for development using a variety of tools and programs.</p>
			<p>In addition to our in-house development options, HCSC partners with select universities in our operating states to support
				continuing education programs that are relevant and add value to our employees as they strive to grow professionally.</p>


			<h4>Leadership Development</h4>
			<p>We offer companywide programs that provide all leaders the opportunity to strengthen their management skills and develop
				leadership behaviors. Transitioning to new leadership roles creates new opportunities for development. We support those
				transitions by providing development programs aligned to the specific skill requirements of each new career level. Our
				LEAD profile is the foundation for all our leadership training programs:</p>
