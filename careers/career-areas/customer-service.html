                <h2>What if â€¦ ?</h2>
                <p>What if "customer service" were about both <em>customer and service</em>? What if the difference you'll make could make all the difference in someone's life?</p>
                
                <p>What if you worked at Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC)?</p>
                
                <p>As the largest member-owned health insurer in the nation, HCSC has more than a passing interest in seeing our customers fully satisfied. In the truest sense, our customer service and claims operations professionals are the face of HCSC to our members and the embodiment of our purpose: to do everything in our power to stand with our members in sickness and in health<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>
                
                <p>It's a lot of responsibility, matched only by the opportunities we provide these team members&mdash;opportunities to make a real difference by helping members safely navigate the increasing complexities of health care and access the care and security they depend on. You'll identify opportunities to make things even better; to thrive in a true learning environment; and to enjoy flexible work arrangements. All this in addition to one of the industry's most robust benefits offerings.</p>
                
                <p>We encourage you to reimagine all that customer service can be and join an organization that's redefining how value is added for its customers. </p>
