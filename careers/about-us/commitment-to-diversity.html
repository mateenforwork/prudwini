								<em>"The Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI) is focused on uniting talent from all lines of difference to benefit
									all lines of business. In doing so, our framework of inclusion not only targets race and gender, but other critical
									dimensions of inclusion, such as disabilities, armed forces, sexual orientation, generations, multi-culturalism,
									well-being and work-life fit. However, creating an inclusive workforce is not just the responsibility of the CDI,
									it's everyone's responsibility."</em>
