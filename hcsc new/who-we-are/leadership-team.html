                    </p>
                    <p>As president and CEO of Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC), Paula Steiner is committed to expanding
                        access to quality, cost-effective health care to all Americans. Firmly focused on the health care
                        needs of&nbsp;more than&nbsp;15 million HCSC members, Steiner leads the nation&rsquo;s largest customer-owned
                        health insurer, which operates as Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma
                        and Texas.</p>
                    <p>HCSC &mdash; the nation&rsquo;s fourth largest health insurer overall &mdash; also operates Dearborn
                        National, Medecision, Academic HealthPlans and Innovista Health Solutions. HCSC has more than 20,000
                        employees.
                    </p>
                    <p>Under Steiner&rsquo;s leadership, HCSC continues on the path to help achieve a sustainable health care
                        system that provides access to affordable care for generations to come for all Americans. As part
                        of her commitment to addressing the needs of today&rsquo;s health care consumer, Steiner&rsquo;s
                        priorities include: advancing HCSC&rsquo;s leadership role in value-based care solutions, including
                        accountable care organization arrangements with providers; promoting the use of technology and data
                        to an even greater extent to help physicians help their patients; and looking for better ways to
