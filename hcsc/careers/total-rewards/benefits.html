						<h3>Work/Life Flexibility &#124; Time Off</h3>
					</a>
					<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
						<h4>Holidays</h4>
						<p>We offer 10 paid holidays, including floating Diversity days, which provide you the opportunity to celebrate the most
							meaningful times with people who mean the most to you.</p>

						<h4>Personal Time Off (PTO)</h4>
						<p>PTO is accrued monthly and based on years of service and level of position, starting at a minimum of 15 days annually
							for full-time employees. HCSC also offers employees the opportunity to buy an additional week of PTO for greater flexibility.</p>

						<h4>Flexibility</h4>
						<p>We want to help our employees balance their careers and personal lives. Our flexible work options make that possible.
							Flex-time schedules and work-from-home opportunities are available for many roles at HCSC. We invest in technologies
							that support collaboration and productivity, whether you're at the office, on the road, or at home. You can learn
							more about flexible work arrangements for a specific job during the interview process.</p>


						<h4>Parental Leave</h4>
						<p>Adding a member to your family is an exciting and busy time! Employees with one year of service are eligible for up
							to six weeks of 100 percent company paid Parental Leave which applies equally to mothers and fathers of both birth
							parents and those who adopt children.</p>


						<h4>Paid Military Leave</h4>
						<p>In special recognition of employees who also serve their country in the military, HCSC provides the benefits to employees
							who take a leave of absence to serve in the uniformed services during the war. HCSC will supplement the pay the employee
							receives for his or her regular base pay at the time of call to active duty, for up to 12 months of active duty.</p>


						<h4>Bereavement Leave</h4>
						<p>We provide up to 4 days of bereavement leave to employees on the date of hire for a death in the immediate family.</p>

						<h3>Financial Well-Being</h3>
					</a>
					<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
						<h4>Pension Plan</h4>
						<p>HCSC continues to offer a cash balance, company-funded pension plan to our eligible employees. You make no contributions
							and since it's a defined benefit plan, you don't have any investment risk. You are eligible to participate after one
							year of service and vested after three years. Even if you leave the company before normal retirement age, you'll still
							keep your vested benefit earned during your HCSC career. For qualified employees, HCSC contributes to the Plan on
							a gradually increasing sliding scale based on age, starting at 3 percent of your base pay. </p>


						<h4>401(k) Plan</h4>
						<p>The HCSC 401(k) Plan and the Employee Pension Plan are designed to work in tandem. The 401(k) Plan provides a way for
							eligible employees to automatically save with pre-tax contributions and company match on a dollar-for-dollar basis
							for the first one percent of gross earnings and 50 percent on the next five percent. That is a company match of up
							to 3.5 percent when you contribute 6 percent of your gross pay. You'll benefit from the power of tax-deferred compounded
							growth and high-quality investment options available through Prudential Retirement.</p>


						<h4>Life and AD&#38;D</h4>
						<p>Qualified HCSC employees enjoy company-paid life insurance and AD&#38;D coverage.</p>


						<h4>Dependent Life Coverage</h4>
						<p>Several levels of dependent life coverage are available for employees who are either married and/or have children.</p>


						<h4>Flexible Spending Accounts</h4>
						<p>Flexible Spending Account programs allow you set aside pre-tax money to pay for health care and dependent care expenses
							throughout the benefit year.</p>


						<h4>Short-Term Disability &#38; Long-Term Disability</h4>
						<p>We provide Short-Term Disability &#38; Long-Term Disability benefits to help you regain your wellness in the event
							of an injury or other health issue which prevents you from working.</p>


						<h4>Parking</h4>
						<p>Most HCSC office locations have free or discounted parking or shuttle service available for employees.</p>


						<h4>Transportation Reimbursement Account</h4>
						<p>Employees can offset the cost of their commutes by setting aside pre-tax funds annually to cover transit and/or parking
							expenses.</p>

						<h4> Bonus Program </h4>

							employees based on corporate performance, and the achievement of team and individual goals. Many of these goals are
							centered around how well we're serving our members.</p>

						<h4> Credit Union</h4>
						<p> Membership in our Credit Union is available to all employees. It affords our employees an excellent and convenient
							alternative to traditional banking resources.</p>

						<h4> Volunteer Recognition &#38; Matching Dollars</h4>
						<p>HCSC encourages employees to track their individual and team volunteer work and recognizes volunteerism through prizes
							and other rewards. For every volunteer hour an employee spends with a qualified nonprofit organization, that community
							partner can receive $20 per hour in matching dollars—up to $2,000 annually. And that can go a long way toward feeding
							the hungry, immunizing children and even building a playground. Just ask our partners!</p>


						<h4> Employee Assistance Program</h4>
						<p> Confidential counseling is made available to all employees 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can gain access to
							referrals for key services, discounts with partners and helpful information to help manage your personal commitments.</p>

						<h4> Group Legal Service</h4>

							financial planning assistance.</p>
